There are exactly ten ways of selecting three from five, 12345:
123, 124, 125, 134, 135, 145, 234, 235, 245, and 345
In combinatorics, we use the notation, (5 3)=10.
In general, (n r)=n!r!(n−r)!, where r≤n, n!=n×(n−1)×...×3×2×1, and 0!=1.
It is not until n=23, that a value exceeds one-million: (23 10)=1144066.
How many, not necessarily distinct, values of (n r) for 1≤n≤100, are greater than one-million?
